# Core
Here is a project idea for making automated voting system using arduino.It might seem a bit cliche but we have integrated exciting addons to this project to make it more robust.GSM technology is used to send messages to the persons who haven't voted in several session gaps which helps in increasing the voters percentage.Here,You can find the entire Cpp code to process in arduino ide.Libraries related to fingerprint sensor and others should be installed in the ide itself.
MAIN COMPONENTS USED:
1).Arduino UNO
2).fingerprint sensor
3).GSM
4).Buckle converter
5).adapter 1.5mA.
